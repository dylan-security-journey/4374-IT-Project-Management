# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3: Project Methodology

## 3.1 Agenda
- Project & System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)  
- Process Groups & Knowledge Areas  
- Predictive Methodologies (Waterfall, Spiral, Prototyping, RAD)  
- Adaptive Methodologies (Agile, Scrum)  
- IT Project Management Methodologies:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 3.2 Project Life Cycle

### Definition
- Sequence of phases a project goes through from initiation to closure.  
- Provides a framework for **systematic and effective project management**.  

### Phases of Traditional Project Life Cycle
1. **Concept Phase** â€“ Business case, high-level scope, cost estimate, approval.  
2. **Development Phase** â€“ Detailed scope, cost estimates, vendor selection, contracts.  
3. **Implementation Phase** â€“ Deliverables produced, solution tested & deployed, user training.  
4. **Closeout Phase** â€“ Contracts closed, lessons learned, solution transitioned to support.  

### Key Points
- Early phase: lowest resources, highest uncertainty, high stakeholder influence.  
- Middle phase: increasing certainty, more resources needed.  
- Final phase: ensure requirements are met, sponsor approves completion.  
- **Management Reviews (Phase Gates)** ensure project alignment with goals before continuing:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## 3.3 System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### Definition
- Framework describing phases in developing/maintaining IT systems.  
- Methodology applied in **development, implementation, and close-out** phases.  

### Approaches
- **Predictive (Traditional)** â€“ Clear scope, predictable schedule/cost.  
- **Adaptive (Agile/ASD)** â€“ Scope unclear, iterative, mission-driven:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 3.4 Predictive Life Cycles

1. **Waterfall Model**  
   - Linear, sequential stages.  
   - Assumes stable requirements.  
   - Used in large-scale systems like ERP.  

2. **Spiral Model**  
   - Iterative cycles.  
   - Flexible to change, allows revisions later.  

3. **Prototyping Model**  
   - Build prototypes to clarify requirements.  
   - Useful in UI-heavy projects.  

4. **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**  
   - Short development cycles with prototypes + user feedback.  
   - Heavy user involvement.  
   - Agile evolved from RAD:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## 3.5 Adaptive Software Development: Agile

### Agile Principles
- **Embrace change** â€“ even late in development.  
- **Working software** is the primary progress measure.  
- **Sustainable pace** â€“ avoid burnout.  
- **Continuous collaboration** â€“ between devs, business, and customers.  
- **Iterative development** â€“ frequent, small releases.  
- **Customer feedback** guides future work:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  

---

## 3.6 Scrum Framework

### Characteristics
- Iterative & incremental delivery.  
- Frequent small releases; adapt to requirements.  

### Roles
- **Product Owner** â€“ Defines value, prioritizes backlog.  
- **ScrumMaster** â€“ Facilitates process, removes blockers.  
- **Scrum Team** â€“ Cross-functional, self-organizing (5â€“9 people).  

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog** â€“ Prioritized list of features.  
- **Sprint Backlog** â€“ Selected items for current sprint.  
- **Burndown Chart** â€“ Visual of work remaining.  

### Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning** â€“ Decide sprint goals.  
- **Daily Scrum** â€“ Short check-in on progress.  
- **Sprint Review** â€“ Demonstrate completed work.  
- **Sprint Retrospective** â€“ Reflect on improvements:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

## 3.7 Project Management in Waterfall vs Agile

### Waterfall Tasks
- **Pre-initiation** â€“ Scope, sponsor, PM selection, business case.  
- **Initiation** â€“ Project charter, stakeholder register.  
- **Planning** â€“ Scope statement, WBS, Gantt chart, risk register.  
- **Execution** â€“ Deliverables, team management, communication.  
- **Monitoring/Controlling** â€“ Track progress, control changes.  
- **Closing** â€“ Customer acceptance, lessons learned:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  

### Agile/Scrum Tasks
- **Pre-initiation** â€“ Define roles, plan releases & sprints.  
- **Planning** â€“ Product backlog, sprint backlog, velocity estimates.  
- **Execution** â€“ Iterative development, daily scrums, stakeholder feedback.  
- **Monitoring/Controlling** â€“ Daily scrums, sprint boards, burndown charts.  
- **Closing** â€“ Sprint retrospectives to improve process:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

## 3.8 Scenarios

- **University Enrollment System** (Waterfall project stalled due to poor planning, stakeholder misalignment).  
- **Sprint to Nowhere** (Scrum project failed due to backlog mismanagement, lack of DoD, poor sprint discipline).  

---

## 3.9 IT Project Management Methodologies

- **PRINCE2** â€“ Structured, process-driven.  
- **Agile** â€“ Flexible, iterative.  
- **RUP (Rational Unified Process)** â€“ Iterative software dev process.  
- **Six Sigma** â€“ Focus on quality improvement.  
- **SAP Activate** â€“ SAP-specific implementation methodology:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

## 3.10 Process Groups & Knowledge Areas

### Process Groups
1. Initiating  
2. Planning  
3. Executing  
4. Monitoring & Controlling  
5. Closing  

### Knowledge Areas
- Integration Management  
- Scope Management  
- Time Management  
- Cost Management  
- Quality Management  
- Human Resource Management  
- Communications Management

âœ… **Key Takeaway**: Chapter 3 contrasts traditional (predictive) and adaptive (agile/scrum) methodologies while linking them to the project life cycle, SDLC, and PM process groups/knowledge areas.
